# ðŸš— Road Detection AI System

This project is a **Django-based web application** that uses AI to classify car images as either **"On Road"** or **"Off Road"**. The application provides an admin verification system, allowing administrators to review and verify the AI-generated status for each image and decide whether to accept or reject the report. The final status is displayed to the user, providing them with clear and accurate classification details.
